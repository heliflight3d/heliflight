## Heliflight 3D

Heliflight 3D is flight controller software (firmware) used to fly single-rotor helicopters.

This fork differs from Baseflight and Cleanflight in that it focuses on 3D flight performance for helicopters. Heliflight 3D was forked from Betaflight 4.2.

## Important Notice: During the initial development period, Heliflight 3D is *NOT* optimized for slower hardware.  It is highly suggested to use a STM32F7 based flight controller.

### Heliflight has a Discord server. You can find it here: https://discord.gg/3Ys2Z6W

### Installation for End-Users:

Firmware must be built by the user. Or if you have a standard flight controller board that supports a unified target like STM32F7X2, you might ask a developer nicely on Discord for a compiled version. But honestly, 10% the fun is saying you compiled it yourself straight from the source code.

See more here: https://github.com/James-T1/heliflight-3d/wiki/How-to-Build-Heliflight-3D

### Installation for Beta-testers:

All users are Beta-testers. See above.

## Betaflight News

![Important Notice: Support for STM32F3 based flight controllers was dropped in Betaflight 4.1. (This includes all boards with 'F3' in the name.)](docs/assets/images/stm32f3_retirement_notice.svg)

(Please see the [note](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight#end-of-active-development-for-stm32f3-based-flight-controllers) below.)

### Requirements for the submission of new and updated targets

The following new requirements for pull requests adding new targets or modifying existing targets are put in place from now on:

1. No new F3 based targets will be accepted;

2. For any new target that is to be added, only a Unified Target config into https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/tree/master/configs/default needs to be submitted. See the [instructions](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/TargetMaintenance/CreatingAUnifiedTarget.md) for how to create a Unified Target configuration. If there is no Unified Target for the MCU type of the new target (see instructions above), then a 'legacy' format target definition into `src/main/target/` has to be submitted as well;

3. For changes to existing targets, the change needs to be applied to the Unified Target config in https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/tree/master/configs/default. If no Unified Target configuration for the target exists, a new Unified Target configuration will have to be created and submitted. If there is no Unified Target for the MCU type of the new target (see instructions above), then an update to the 'legacy' format target definition in `src/main/target/` has to be submitted alongside the update to the Unified Target configuration.


### End of active development for STM32F3 based flight controllers

For a while now, development of Betaflight for flight controllers based on the STM32F3 chip has been hampered by a severe limitation that this chip has: Unlike the STM32F4 and STM32F7 models, the STM32F3 versions that are used on flight controllers have only a very limited amount of flash space available to fit the firmware into. This has meant that, starting from around version 3.3, the majority of the new features that were developed for Betaflight could not be added to STM32F3 based boards. Even worse, due to improvement in basic features, other more and more of the less commonly used features had to be removed from these flight controllers, and a number of them are at a point where they only support the bare minimum of functionality required to make them fly.

This means that, even if we kept supporting STM32F3 based boards in future releases, there would only be little advantage in this, as there simply is no space left on STM32F3 to add any of the new features that these releases will contain.

For this reason, and because the effort required to remove features from STM32F3 based flight controllers on a weekly basis is cutting into the time that we have to actually develop new features, we have decided to drop support for STM32F3 based flight controllers after the last release of 4.0.

This does not mean that it won't be possible to use these flight controllers after this point in time - they will still work fine when used with the last release of 4.0, just as there are thousands of users who are still enjoying their STM32F1 based flight controllers with Betaflight 3.2.5. We will also strive to keep these versions supported in new releases of configurator, so that users still using these flight controllers will be able to configure them with the same configurator that they use to configure their STM32F4 and STM32F7 based boards.


## Features

To simplify the codebase and reduce the potential for errors, we have begun the work of stripping out the miniquad-specific code in Betaflight and implementing helicopter specific features in their place. The helicopter-specific features include:

* High-speed predictive main motor governor using BlHeli32 ESCs with BiDirectional DSHOT
* Support for motor-driven, variable pitch, and combination MD+VP tails
* Full configuration via Transmitter telemetry (initially FrSky LUA support)
* Configurable Bailout/Rescue function
* Tail pre-comp for collective changes / piro compensation / collective governor boost / etc.
* Re-work the Betaflight configurator to support the HF3D functionality as necessary

All of the great stuff that exists in Betaflight that is relevant to helicopters remains:

* Stabilization modes
* 1-wire Bi-directional DSHOT w/ RPM telemetry
* DSHOT telemetry output support
* ESC configuration with BLHeli passthrough
* Configuration via Transmitter telemetry
* Blackbox logging and vibration analysis
* Excellent RC input filtering/smoothing
* Vibration filtering
* 1-wire RX interface w/ telemetry (FPORT, etc.)
* GPS Rescue could eventually work

## Support and Developers Channel

There's a dedicated Slack chat channel here:

https://slack.betaflight.com/

Etiquette: Don't ask to ask and please wait around long enough for a reply - sometimes people are out flying, asleep or at work and can't answer immediately.

## Configuration Tool

To configure Heliflight you should use the Heliflight-configurator GUI tool (Windows/OSX/Linux) which can be found here:

https://github.com/heliflight/heliflight-configurator

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. You can contribute in many ways:

* implement a new feature in the firmware or in configurator (see [below](#Developers));
* documentation updates and corrections;
* How-To guides - received help? Help others!
* bug reporting & fixes;
* new feature ideas & suggestions;
* provide a new translation for configurator, or help us maintain the existing ones (see [below](#Translators)).

The best place to start is the Betaflight Slack (registration [here](https://slack.betaflight.com/)). Next place is the github issue tracker:

https://github.com/heliflight/heliflight/issues
https://github.com/heliflight/heliflight-configurator/issues

Before creating new issues please check to see if there is an existing one, search first otherwise you waste people's time when they could be coding instead!

## Translators

We want to make Betaflight accessible for pilots who are not fluent in English, and for this reason we are currently maintaining translations into 18 languages for Betaflight Configurator: Català, Deutsch, Español, Euskera, Français, Galego, Hrvatski, Bahasa Indonesia, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Latviešu, Português, Português Brasileiro, polski, Русский язык, Svenska, 简体中文.
We have got a team of volunteer translators who do this work, but additional translators are always welcome to share the workload, and we are keen to add additional languages. If you would like to help us with translations, you have got the following options:
- if you help by suggesting some updates or improvements to translations in a language you are familiar with, head to [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/betaflight-configurator) and add your suggested translations there;
- if you would like to start working on the translation for a new language, or take on responsibility for proof-reading the translation for a language you are very familiar with, please head to the Betaflight Slack (registration [here](https://slack.betaflight.com/)), and join the '#team\_translation' channel - the people in there can help you to get a new language added, or set you up as a proof reader.
